Question 1: 
a) Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 


AOV, in my opinion, is a good metric to use when you’re analyzing an individual store. However, when you’re analyzing a 
market, like for this instance a shoe market, AOV is not appropriate as different stores have different AOVs. As a result 
using the Total Revenue/Total Orders ($3145.13) all of 100 stores will not portray each store fairly as each store has 
varying AOVs. AOV is nice to see how an individual store is doing from month to month. It’s crucial for one store because 
they can use that number and improve their store by either upgrading their Shopify Websites, investing in more ads or 
brainstorming different options. 

Summary AOVs of Sample Shops:
AOV Shop 42: $235,101.49  Calculation is Total Revenue/Total Orders = $11,990,176/51 = SUM(D2078:D2128)/COUNT(E2078:E2128)
AOV Shop 78: $49,213.04   Calculation is Total Revenue/Total Orders = $2263800/46 = SUM(D3866:D3911)/COUNT(E3866:E3911)
AOV Shop 1: $308.82 	    Calculation is Total Revenue/Total Orders = $13,588/44 = SUM(D2:D45)/COUNT(E2:E45)
AOV Shop 2: $174.33 	    Calculation is Total Revenue/Total Orders = $9588/55 = SUM(D46:D100)/COUNT(E46:E100)


By going through the orders from different shops, there was one store (Shop 78) that sells one shoe for $25,725. 
What is also important to consider is that Shop 42 has frequent orders of customers buying in bulk (2000 items) for $704000, 
each shoe being $352. Shop 42 would have an AOV of $235,101.49. These 2 stores (Shop 42 and 78) seem like outliers to the shoe 
market. Removing these two shops in the analysis would give very different results.  

I believe if one wants to look at the entire dataset but evaluate the data in a better way, one possible approach would be to 
separate the shops into bins or groups. Although they are all sneakers perhaps they could be separated into categories based on 
model type and price: ‘Everyday Sneakers’, ‘Branded Sneakers’, ‘Exclusive Sneakers’. This way it avoids discrepancies when looking 
at the average. 




b) What metric would you report for this dataset?

A metric that I would use in this case would be the Average Basket Value as it looks at your total revenue by the total number 
of items placed. For this dataset specifically I would look at the Total Revenue of 100 Sneaker Shops/Total Numbers of Items Sold. 



c) What is its value?
ABV = Total Revenue of 100 Sneaker Shops/Total Numbers of Items Sold = $15,725,640/43936 = SUM(D2:D5001)/SUM(E2:E5001) =$357.92
The value is $357.92.

What is also interesting to see is what the ABV would be without the two outlier shops (Shop 42 and 78). 
ABV = Total Revenue of 98 Sneaker Shops/Total Numbers of Items Sold = $1,471,664/9785 = $150.4
The removal of just these two shops changes the ABV from $357.92 to $150.4!



Question 2: 
a) How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
	
There were a total of 54 orders that were shipped by Speedy Express. 

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM [Orders]
JOIN [Shippers]
ON [Orders].ShipperID = [Shippers].ShipperID
WHERE [Shippers].ShipperName = "Speedy Express"




b) What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
	
The last name of the employee with the most orders is Peacock with a total of 40 records out of the 196 number of records.. 

SQL Query: 
SELECT o.EmployeeID, e.LastName, COUNT(*) TotalOrders FROM Orders o
JOIN Employees e
ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
GROUP BY o.EmployeeID
ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC



c) What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
	
The most ordered product from customers in Germany was Gorgonzola Telino. 

SQL Query:
SELECT od.*, p.ProductName, o.OrderID, c.CustomerID, c.Country, COUNT(*) FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Products p, Orders o, Customers c
ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID AND od.OrderID = o.OrderID AND o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE c.Country = "Germany"
GROUP BY p.ProductID
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
